# Project Proposal Template

!!! warning "GSoC 2024 will not have Mathesar"
    **Mathesar [will not be participating](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues/3381) in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024** due to lack of maintainer capacity. We hope to resume participation in 2025.

    This guide was for GSoC 2023.

This is the proposal template for applications to any mentorship programs that we participate in. **Proposals that do not follow this template will not be considered for GSoC**.

We recommend creating a Google Doc that follows this structure and sharing it with the mentors. Please make sure that all mentors have commenting permissions.
