these are notes derived from a session held in 2023 GSoC mentor summit
    - the audience of these notes is the team at Mathesar
    - the tone is supposed to be one of recommendation
        - these are above all things to consider, as opposed to blindly follow
    - written up by Dom
    - they discuss techniques, methods, approaches
        - that we might use in upcoming GSoCs to improve the proposal phase
    - the motivation for having this session and keeping these notes
        - is that our previous GSoC proposal phases required a lot of effort and time
            - and we're interested in improving that

a different set of notes for the same meeting can be found [here](proposal-phase-gsoc-summit-session-minutes.md).

notes begin below:

start early
best students start interacting very early
    - same goes for organizations

encourage demonstrating value by contributing and being active
    - how that goes can be a strong indicator of how fitting a candidate is
    - only accept proposals late, encourage preparation by becoming good contributor
        - e.g. last 2 weeks before the deadline
    - encourage preparing via contribution
        - prevents candidate from endlessly refining their proposal
        - might give more valuable information than a highly refined proposal

instead of defining very concrete projects
    - consider defining themes
        - i.e. be more abstract, leave wiggle room
    - let candidates find what needs to be done
        - this optimizes for contributors that fill in the gaps
    - this might not work for every project
        - for example,
            - when there aren't a lot of things to be done
            - or when the possible projects are highly difficult and require great insight
    - nonetheless, vagueness of project idea can be a useful parameter to tweak

public proposal
clear and fair; lots of communication
    - fairness and openness make proposal phase smoother
self-filtering
    - once you make communication, discussion and feedback open for everyone to review
    - lower quality candidates filter themselves out
open communication saves on management
    - when others see competition for a given project idea,
      - they'll naturally consider less popular project ideas

high standards
    - having high standards can save on work
    - be clear (with yourself and others) about what kind of
        - contributors and mentoring you're looking for
harsh about not needing hand holding
    - if a candidate doesn't seem ready this year, tell them that
mentor exhaustion is a concern

trade-off between candidate's skill and candidate's need for mentoring
    - when selecting candidates there are at least two things you can optimize for
        - how good a candidate already is 
        - how much of an impact we can make by mentoring this candidate
    - i.e. balancing maturity and newbieness
    - a candidate that is not familiar even with the most basic things
        - might derive more benefit from mentoring
        - compared to someone who's fairly self-relient and skilled

tooling project ideas
    - projects that improve things which are often neglected
a project idea needs to be easy to review
    - otherwise mentors will be taxed more
    - this applies to proposal review and to code review
have contributor prepare documents for future contributors
    - documents that help figure things out
    - and/or take first steps

proposal is a start: ultimate goal is to get contributor involved in community
getting long term involvement
    - community building might be
        - more than just getting a project done

outreach and drawing in good candidates
    - seo optimization in and via gsoc
        - look at how gsoc project search works for candidates
        - optimize our relevant documents based on that
    - blogging by contributors in our subdomain
        - a lot of screenshots
        - free seo
    - doing a video
