## Preface 

- these are notes derived from a session held in 2023 GSoC mentor summit
    - the audience of these notes is the team at Mathesar
    - the tone is supposed to be one of recommendation
        - these are above all things to consider, as opposed to blindly follow
    - written up by Dom
    - they discuss techniques, methods, approaches
        - that we might use in upcoming GSoCs to improve the proposal phase
    - the motivation for having this session and keeping these notes
        - is that our previous GSoC proposal phases required a lot of effort and time
            - and we're interested in improving that

- a different set of notes for the same meeting
    - (raw and not written by Dom)
    - can be found [here](proposal-phase-gsoc-summit-session-minutes.md).

## Notes

### Miscellaneous

- start early
    - best students start interacting very early
    - same goes for organizations

- encourage demonstrating value by contributing and being active
    - how that goes can be a strong indicator of how fitting a candidate is
    - consider only accepting proposals late,
        - e.g. last 2 weeks before the deadline
    - encourage preparing via contribution and community involvement
        - prevents candidate from endlessly refining their proposal
        - might give more valuable information than a highly refined proposal

- instead of defining very concrete projects
    - consider defining themes
        - i.e. be more abstract, leave wiggle room
    - let candidates find what needs to be done
        - this optimizes for contributors that fill in the gaps
    - this might not work for every project
        - for example,
            - when there aren't a lot of things to be done
            - or when the possible projects are highly difficult and require great insight
    - nonetheless, vagueness of project idea can be a useful parameter to tweak

### Communication

- public, clear, fair comms
    - some orgs keep proposals private
        - but insist that meaningful discussion/feedback be public
        - while others keep everything public
            - and reassure candidates that others won't be able to steal their ideas
            - and note that "this is in the spirit of open source"
    - clear and fair
        - need openness for fairness
        - private proposal reviews give candidates with many private discussions an unnecessary advantage
    - lots of communication
    - these things together make proposal phase smoother

- self-filtering
    - once you make communication, discussion and feedback open for everyone to review
    - lower quality candidates filter themselves out
        - because they are able to gauge their fitness relative to others'

- open communication saves on management
    - when others see competition for a given project idea,
        - they'll naturally consider less popular project ideas
    - last GSoC this was a problem
        - best candidates competed for the same project
        - adhoc solution was to ask one of them to submit another proposal
            - it turned out weak, because was done at the last moment
            - but we knew candidate to be strong

- encourage threading of conversations
    - and make those threads accessible to other candidates
    - that way candidates can review discussions around a given project idea
        - reducing redundant communication,
        - and encouraging communication between candidates
    - and also let's them evaluate their competition
        - which helps distribute candidates between project ideas
        - and let's candidates self-filter
        - reducing work for the org
    - zulip was introduced in this context
        - superior threading features to matrix/element

- have contributor prepare documents for future contributors
    - documents that help figure things out
    - and/or take first steps

### Candidate selection and community

- high standards
    - having high standards can save on work
    - be clear (with yourself and others) about what kind of
        - contributors and mentoring you're looking for
        - if a candidate doesn't seem ready this year, tell them that
    - be harsh about not needing hand holding
        - if you can't or don't want to provide that
    - mentor exhaustion is a concern

- trade-off between candidate's skill and candidate's need for mentoring
    - when selecting candidates there are at least two things you can optimize for
        - how good a candidate already is 
        - how much of an impact we can make by mentoring this candidate
    - i.e. balancing maturity and newbieness
    - a candidate that is not familiar even with the most basic things
        - might derive more benefit from mentoring
        - compared to someone who's fairly self-relient and skilled
    - which is better for community?

- proposal/project is a start
    - ultimate goal is to get contributor involved in community
    - community building might be
        - more than just getting projects done

### Project ideas

- tooling project ideas
    - projects that improve things which are often neglected
        - tests, linters, docs, dev scripts
- a project idea needs to be easy to review
    - otherwise mentors will be taxed more
    - this applies to proposal review and to code review
    - useful criteria when evaluating project ideas
- some projects (e.g. scala) draw in very skilled candidates
    - such projects need challenging projects to satisfy those candidates
    - having project ideas that are all similarly challenging might not be desirable

### Outreach

- outreach can help draw in more or better candidates
- seo optimization in and via gsoc
    - look at how gsoc project search works for candidates
        - optimize our relevant documents based on that
    - ask contributors to maintain blogs on our subdomains
        - helps future contributors
        - gives us seo benefits
        - ask them to use a lot of screenshots
            - helps newcomers
- doing a video
    - a video to advertise org to potential candidates
    - helps reach more candidates
