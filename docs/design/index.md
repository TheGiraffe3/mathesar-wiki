# Design

This is the homepage for Mathesar design work, closely related to [Product](/product) and [Engineering](/engineering).

## Documents
Outputs of our design process.

- [Specs](/design/specs) - *List of design specs*
- [Exploration](/design/exploration) - *Rough notes for initial research and discovery*
- [Reports](/design/reports) - *Conclusions drawn after research*

## Workflow
Design tasks are [tracked on GitHub](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22work%3A+design%22) and are closely tied to our [Roadmap](/product/roadmap). 

We aim to complete design work for a milestone at least 2-3 weeks before the deadline to allow sufficient time for implementation. Design is usually at a couple of milestones ahead of backend work.
