# Workflow
Design tasks are [tracked on GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22work%3A+design%22) and are closely tied to our [Roadmap](/product/roadmap). 

We aim to complete design work for a milestone at least 2-3 weeks before the deadline to allow sufficient time for implementation. Design is usually at a couple of milestones ahead of backend work.
