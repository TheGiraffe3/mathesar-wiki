Mathesar is a straightforward open source tool that provides a **spreadsheet-like interface** to a PostgreSQL **database**. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators work with data more independently and comfortably â€“ **no technical skills needed**.

You can use Mathesar to build **data models**, **enter data**, and even **build reports**. You host your own Mathesar installation, which gives you ownership, privacy, and control of your data.

See https://mathesar.org for more information about the product.

## Current status
Mathesar's is in public alpha as of March 2023. We are actively looking for users to [install Mathesar](https://docs.mathesar.org/install/) and [open issues](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/new/choose) to help us improve the product.
