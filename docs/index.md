# Mathesar Wiki

This wiki is a knowledge base for **people who are helping build [Mathesar](https://mathesar.org)**, a straightforward open source tool that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database.

We use the wiki to document technical specs, designs, meeting notes, roles, responsibilities, and other workflow-related information.

Anyone can propose edits to this wiki by making a PR against the [wiki repository](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-wiki/).
