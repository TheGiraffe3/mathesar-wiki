# Release process

Our release process works like this:

1. Plan the release â€” this is done in Basecamp and GitHub milestones
1. [Cut the release](./cutting.md)
1. [QA the release](./qa.md) and [write the release notes](./notes.md)
1. [Publish the release](./publication.md)
1. [Update our servers](../engineering/server-update-process.md)
1. [Announce the release](./announce.md)

!!! note "Release guides require the GitHub CLI"
    Some of our steps within the release process require, `gh`, the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). You'll need to have it installed in order to copy-paste commands.
