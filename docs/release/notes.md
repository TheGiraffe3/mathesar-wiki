# Writing release notes

You can begin this process before the release is [cut](./cutting.md).

1. Generate a release notes document. Follow steps [here](https://github.com/mathesar-foundation/mathesar/blob/develop/docs/docs/releases/README.md).

1. Create a PR for the release notes.

    As the release nears, keep the PR up-to-date periodically by re-running the release notes helper script.

    Have other team members review the release notes as necessary.

1. Merge the release notes PR into the release branch after [QA](./qa.md) is finished and before [publication](./publication.md) has begun.
