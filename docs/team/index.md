# Team

Mathesar team members belong either to the **core team** or the **community team**. The core team maintains the project on a day-to-day basis. The community team contributes to Mathesar's design and development fairly regularly and has write access to the `mathesar` repository and wiki.

For now, joining the team is invite-only.
