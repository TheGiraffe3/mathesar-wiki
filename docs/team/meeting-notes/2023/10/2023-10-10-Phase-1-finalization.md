# 2023-10-10 Phase 1 finalization call with Kriti

- **Questions for Kriti**:
    - SavvyCal -- round robin vs single person (Ghislaine)
    - Group email -- Fresh desk vs CC-ed Google group
    - Do we need to make any adjustments to the email content related to the gift card amount?

### Conclusions:
* For the first few weeks:
    * It would make sense to have one person (or both to work out all the kinks) form the User Interview project being on the calls
* SavvyCal:
    * To begin with, we will go with a single person (Ghislaine) handling the scheduling
* Group email:
    * Kriti recommends using Freshdesk to send mails and the email for calls
* Incentives:
    * It would make sense to send the first set of emails without an incentive to the GH users
    * We can figure out the incentive for the mailing list later.
    * Take out the word Amazon, we'll only mention a $25 giftcard.
