# 2023-10-17 User Feedback Meeting

**Team Updates:**

Sean:
- Sent out 4 emails, received 2 responses already
- Is keeping track of outreach activity in a csv file
- Emails should be very communicative, and the person responsible must be mindful of maintaining the same style.

Action Items:
- We'll parallelize sending out the emails to the GH users
	- Sean: We need to delicately push the user into providing us as much as information as possible
- Pavish is going to add CRM entries for 2 users who have filled our survey and interested in having a conversation with us
	- Pavish: We should prioritize sending emails and reaching out to them since they are organic leads
	- Pavish will be sending out the emails. He will request a review once he's drafted the mails.
- We need to set a notification for the surveys. Ghislaine will be figuring this out.

Next:
- We'll discuss emailing the mailing list after we are ready with the release and the funding announcement.
	- Single mail with funding announcement, current progress, and call link.
- We'll discuss Phase-3 (increasing the top part of the funnel eg., with chat option in our website) next week, once Ghislaine is back.
