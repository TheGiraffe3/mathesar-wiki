# 2024-01-18 Product big-picture meeting

## Brainstorm permission handling - Shareable connections & Browsable DB objects

Idea mailed to [Mathesar developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/mathesar.org/g/mathesar-developers/c/yWR-gsKuU9I/m/6aTtT9k-AwAJ).

## Discussions to have
1. Being able to share explorations to individual logged-in users outside your organization.
2. If a user A is sharing an exploration to another user B, the user B should be able to see the same content as A.
3. Syncing db role with Mathesar permissions.
