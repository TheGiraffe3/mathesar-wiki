# Team management

## Maintenance tasks
- Hold 1:1 meetings with all team members ensuring everyone is productive, happy, and accountable.
  - 1:1 agendas are not set primarily by the manager, it's a space for team members to discuss or communicate whatever they would like to.
  - Non-work related conversation is also fine.
- Review people's work logs and preempt future problems or blockers with high-priority tasks.
- Schedule and facilitate core team weekly meetings.
  - Cancel 1 day in advance if no agenda items are present.
- Schedule team/community events and make sure they have hosts

## Higher-level tasks
- Goal-setting for team and project
- Hiring, onboarding, compensation & benefits
- Training & career/skill development
- Reviewing and improving existing processes
