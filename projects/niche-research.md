## Problem

In order to understand the features and use cases of Mathesar, it's essential to comprehend our target audience. We have identified small businesses using PostgreSQL as a potential niche for Mathesar and would like to conduct research to better understand the market and its needs.

We believe that small businesses using PostgreSQL are a good fit for Mathesar because:

- They already utilize PostgreSQL.
- They are likely interested in database tools.
- Compared to solo developers, these small businesses probably have more collaborative tasks and data-sharing requirements surrounding their database.
- They are likely to collaborate with team members who have a range of technical skills.
- From a business growth perspective, their user expansion rate is expected to surpass that of individual developers.
- Small businesses often rely on a suite of tools to run their operations. If Mathesar integrates well with other popular business tools, that can be a big plus.
- Small businesses, especially those handling sensitive data, will be interested in knowing how Mathesar ensures data security and privacy.
- Small businesses can be more agile in their operations and might be more open to providing feedback for product improvement.

## Solution

1. **Niche Research**:
   #### a. Market Analysis:
      - **Existing Tools Assessment**: Examine tools currently available for managing PostgreSQL databases, especially those popular among small businesses. Understand their strengths, weaknesses, and unique features.
      - **Market Gaps**: Based on public feedback and user reviews, identify unmet needs or problems that users face with these tools.
   
   #### b. Small Business Landscape:
      - **Database Needs**: Seek to understand the specific database requirements of small businesses.
        - Are they seeking flexibility, scalability, or some specific functionalities?
        - What is their typical use of data, and how do they envision their database needs evolving?
      - **Deployment Preferences**:
        - **Self-hosted vs. Cloud-hosted**: Understand the trade-offs small businesses are willing to make in terms of cost, control, and convenience.
        - **Open Source Perception**: Evaluate the importance of open-source solutions in their choice of database management tools. Are they inclined towards open-source because of trust, customization possibilities, or cost factors?

   #### c. Broadening Research Sources:
      - Go beyond conventional platforms like Reddit, Hacker News.

3. **Community Surveys and Engagement**:

   - Engage with the Mathesar community to understand their needs and pain points.
   - Craft and publish a user survey on Mathesar's website.
   - Evaluate survey outcomes, taking into account the feedback and insights about users' experiences and pain points with Mathesar.
   - Identify representative users within the niche of small businesses using PostgreSQL.

4. **Use Case Capture**:

   #### a. Source of Information:
      - **Social Media**: Analyze mentions and discussions related to PostgreSQL database management, especially those expressing challenges with existing tools or seeking new solutions.
      - **Industry Forums**: Look for information in forums specific to industries that can benefit from Mathesar, and note real-world scenarios and challenges posed by users.
      - **Online Communities**: Track discussions related to Mathesar or database management on platforms like Reddit and Hacker News where users might discuss their database management needs or share their experiences with other tools.
   
   #### b. Classification of Use Cases:
      - **Database Beginners**: Capture use cases where users are transitioning from spreadsheets to databases or when they are venturing into the database world for the first time.
      - **Technical & Non-Technical Mix**: Identify scenarios where teams or businesses with a mix of technical and non-technical members are looking for a versatile database tool. Prioritize those cases where Mathesar can bridge the complexity gap.
      - **OLAP vs. OLTP**: Identify use cases that focus on OLAP (producing reports from maintained data) or OLTP (daily transactional data like sales).

5. **Persona Development**:
   - Design user personas that represent the target audience.

6. **Data Analysis and Report**:
   - Aggregate research data and analyze it to identify trends and patterns.
   - Prepare a final report highlighting all findings.
