## Problem

In order to understand the features and use cases of Mathesar, it's essential to comprehend our target audience. We have identified small businesses using PostgreSQL as a potential niche for Mathesar and would like to conduct research to better understand the market and its needs.

We believe that small businesses using PostgreSQL are a good fit for Mathesar because:

- They already utilize PostgreSQL.
- They are likely interested in database tools.
- Compared to solo developers, these small businesses probably have more collaborative tasks and data-sharing requirements surrounding their database.
- They are likely to collaborate with team members who have a range of technical skills.
- From a business growth perspective, their user expansion rate is expected to surpass that of individual developers.
- Small businesses often rely on a suite of tools to run their operations. If Mathesar integrates well with other popular business tools, that can be a big plus.
- Small businesses, especially those handling sensitive data, will be interested in knowing how Mathesar ensures data security and privacy.
- Small businesses can be more agile in their operations and might be more open to providing feedback for product improvement.

1. **Niche Analysis**:
   - Look into current tools for PostgreSQL databases.
   - Identify problems and gaps in the market.
   - Understand small business landscape and their database needs.
     - How do they feel about self-hosted vs. cloud-hosted solutions?
     - Does open source matter to them?
   - Broaden the feedback sources beyond Reddit, Hacker News, and GitHub to capture a wider range of perspectives.

2. **Community Surveys and Engagement**:

   - Engage with the Mathesar community to understand their needs and pain points.
   - Craft and publish a user survey on Mathesar's website.
   - Evaluate survey outcomes, taking into account the feedback and insights about users' experiences and pain points with Mathesar.
   - Identify representative users within the niche of small businesses using PostgreSQL.

3. **Use Case Capture**:
   - Capture and classify potential Mathesar applications from posts in social media, industry forums, and other relevant sources.

4. **Persona Development**:
   - Design user personas that represent the target audience.

5. **Data Analysis and Report**:
   - Aggregate research data and analyze it to identify trends and patterns.
   - Prepare a final report highlighting all findings.
