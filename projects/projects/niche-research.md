## Problem

Small businesses using PostgreSQL databases have specific needs, especially in how they utilize their database for operations, decision-making, and other business aspects. While Mathesar might be an apt solution, it's essential first to understand the market niche and its potential users to tailor the product's features accordingly.

---

## Solution

1. Conduct in-depth market research for the niche and identify potential use cases for Mathesar within that niche.
2. Develop user personas from the research and feedback.
3. Compile a detailed report of the findings and recommendations.

---

## Outcome

A report that provides:

- Key user personas for Mathesar.
- Potential use cases derived from niche analysis and user needs.
- Product development recommendations based on research insights.

---

## Risks

- Research might extend beyond anticipated timeframes.
- Risk of neglecting the broader user audience.
- Selecting use cases or features might pose challenges that go beyond what this research can understand.

---

## Steps for the Project

1. **Niche Analysis**:
   - Look into current tools for PostgreSQL databases.
   - Identify problems and gaps in the market.
2. **Use Case Capture**: Capture and classify potential Mathesar applications from posts in social media, industry forums, and other relevant sources.
3. **User Surveys**:
   - Craft and publish a user survey on Mathesar's website.
   - Evaluate survey outcomes.
4. **Persona Development**: Design user personas that represent the target audience.
5. **Data Analysis and Report**: Aggregate research data and analyze it to identify trends and patterns and prepare a final report.
